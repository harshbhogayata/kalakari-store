# Kalakari - Project Description

## What is Kalakari?

**Kalakari** is an online marketplace that connects Indian artisans directly with customers who appreciate authentic handcrafted products. The name "Kalakari" (कलाकारी) comes from Hindi, meaning "artistry" or "craftsmanship" - perfectly capturing the essence of the platform.

## The Problem We Solve

India has millions of skilled artisans who create beautiful handcrafted products using techniques passed down through generations. However, these artisans face several challenges:

1. **Limited Market Access** - Many artisans are in remote areas with no way to reach buyers beyond their local markets
2. **Middlemen** - Traditional supply chains take large cuts, leaving artisans with minimal profits
3. **No Online Presence** - Most artisans lack the technical knowledge to sell online
4. **Trust Issues** - Buyers don't know if products are authentic or who made them

Kalakari solves these problems by providing a direct bridge between artisans and customers.
